This is all C++ code placed into public domain, either written by me or someone who placed it there. It's quite various in its content. I'll try to maintain it in an understandable order.

Feel free to reuse, modify, distribute, etc. at will, I don't even want to know.

I will be free to appreciate "thank you" that people choose to say, and are not forced to do so by any licence requirement.

Feel free to use it commercially, as long as you need to earn money to have the right to live decently.

Recoding the wheel when there are good ones available is not fun. Forbidding employers to use the good ones is not a solution, because noone but their employees will have to recode it, and the only result is making exploited people suffer more.

You have the right to exist, the right to eat, to have a roof, the right to have a community, to have friends, the right to live. Let no judge, lawyer, company, government, elected people, ever take you that right.

Feel also free to report any bug, or propose enhancements.

Working together is the most efficient way of fulfilling a need, but this is only true when the association is free, and not forced.

Please do not force yourself to contribute, this is not charity.

Contribute when you fully understand that you have something (a lot of things!) to gain in sharing your work. 

Free yourself from any copyright fear, this code is completely free in every possible way.

Free yourself, and I will be free.
