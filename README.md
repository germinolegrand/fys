FYS : Free YourSelf library
===

This is all C++ code placed into public domain, either written by me or someone who placed it there. It's quite various in its content. I'll try to maintain it in an understandable order.

Features
--------

* `algorithm` : generic algorithms that may be proposed into the Standard Library of C++
  * `extract` : find the begin and the end of a sub-range delimited by two delimiters
  * `find_nth` : find the nth element matching the condition
  * `levenshtein_distance` : compute the levenshtein distance between two ranges
  * `windows` : copy a series of sized windows from a range each separated by an offset
* `audio` : classes and utilities for manipulating audio streams
  * `vorbis_streambuf` : a std::streambuf for decoding and demultiplexing multi-channel ogg/vorbis

Public domain and freedom stuff
-------------------------------

FYS is placed in public domain via the [Unlicence](http://unlicense.org/).

Feel free to reuse, modify, distribute, etc. at will, I don't even have to know.

I will be free to appreciate "thank you" that people choose to say, and are not forced to do so by any licence requirement.

Feel free to use it commercially, as long as you need to earn money to have the right to live decently.

Recoding the wheel when there are good ones available is not fun. Forbidding employers to use the good ones is not a solution, because noone but their employees will have to recode it, and the only result is making exploited people suffer more.

You have the right to exist, the right to eat, to have a roof, the right to have a community, to have friends, the right to live. Let no judge, lawyer, company, government, elected people, ever take you that right.

Feel also free to report any bug, or propose enhancements.

Working together is the most efficient way of fulfilling a need, but this is only true when the association is free, and not forced.

Please do not force yourself to contribute, this is not charity.

Contribute when you fully understand that you have something (a lot of things!) to gain in sharing your work. Or if you're not sure, or don't know yet, why not give it a try ?

Free yourself from any copyright fear, this code is completely free in every possible way.

*Free yourself, and I will be free.*
